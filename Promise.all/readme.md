## âœ… So the correct way to say it:

index â†’ identifies which promise in the array you are handling.

isCompleted â†’ counts how many promises have resolved successfully.

## ðŸ“Œ When to use Promise.all()

When you have independent async tasks that can run in parallel.

Example: fetching user info, product list, and settings at the same time.

## âœ… Faster, because all promises start together and resolve in parallel.

## ðŸ“Œ When to avoid Promise.all()

When tasks are dependent (the result of one is needed for the next).

Example: fetch userId first, then use it to fetch user details.

In this case, you need sequential await instead of Promise.all.

## âš¡ Final Polished Statement:-

Use Promise.all() when tasks are independent and can run in parallel (faster).
Avoid Promise.all() when tasks depend on each other â€” use sequential await instead.
