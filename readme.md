## 🧠 The Developer's Mental Checklist

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Before You Write Any Code

## 1. Understand the Problem First

. What exactly am I trying to solve?

. What are the inputs and expected outputs?

. What edge cases might exist?

. Are there any constraints or requirements I'm missing?

---

## 2. Plan Before Coding

. Break the problem into smaller steps

. Think about the data flow

. Consider what could go wrong

. Sketch out the logic first

## While Writing Code

---

## 3. Input Validation (ALWAYS)

```js
// Always ask: What if the input is...
- null or undefined?
- empty string/array/object?
- wrong data type?
- larger/smaller than expected?
- malformed or corrupted?
```

## 4. Error Handling

. Wrap risky operations in try-catch
. Provide meaningful error messages
. Fail gracefully, don't crash
. Log errors for debugging

---

## 5. Naming Rules

. Use descriptive names **(userCount not count)**
